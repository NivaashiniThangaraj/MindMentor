<h1>Coping Strategies</h1>
<p>
    Coping usually involves adjusting to or tolerating negative events or realities while you try to keep your positive self-image and emotional equilibrium. Psychological stress is usually associated with negative life changes, such as losing a job or loved one. However, all changes require some sort of adaptation. Even positive changes — such as getting married or having a child — can be stressful.

Some common coping mechanisms may challenge you to:</p>
<li>	Lower your expectations.</li>
<li>	Ask others to help or assist you.</li>
<li>	Take responsibility for the situation.</li>
<li>	Engage in problem solving.</li>
<li>	Maintain emotionally supportive relationships.</li>
<li>	Maintain emotional composure or, alternatively, expressing distressing emotions.</li>
<li>	Challenge previously held beliefs that are no longer adaptive.</li>
<li>	Directly attempt to change the source of stress.</li>
<li>	Distance yourself from the source of stress.</li>
<li>	View the problem through a religious perspective.</li>
<p>
Experts agree that coping is a process rather than an event. You may alternate between several of the above coping strategies in order to cope with a stressful event.
To put it simply, the following four words can be used to handle stressful situations:
avoid, alter, accept and adapt.
