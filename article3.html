RESILIENCE
</h1>
<p>Rather than avoiding any negative thoughts, mindfulness can help you acknowledge the discomfort so you can focus on taking purposeful action. This, in turn, can boost your resilience. You can practice informal mindfulness every day to stay present in the moment, with purpose.
Resilience is a key factor in protecting and promoting good mental health and is defined as an individual's ability to successfully adapt to life tasks in the face of social disadvantage or highly adverse conditions.
Mindfulness is about living in the present moment and being intentional. Resilience is defined as bouncing back from adverse life events or recovering quickly from difficulties.
There are various types of resiliency. Understanding the four different types of resilience may be essential to building resilience.</p>
<li>Physical resilience. The ability of your body to maintain stamina and face challenges while recovering quickly. Physical resilience often declines with age.</li>
<li>Emotional resilience. The ability to regulate your emotions when faced with stressful or unexpected events.</li>
<li>Mental resilience. The ability to handle crises and learn how to deal with challenges in your life.</li>
<li>Social resilience. The ability of social systems to handle and recover from events such as political, social, and economic problems.</li>
<p>Grounding techniques are one method of building resilience. Grounding techniques are a steady physical and emotional presence supported “by the ground”.
One grounding technique that is helpful for many is the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique. Consider taking time to notice your surroundings in the present moment by naming:</p>
<li>5 things you can see</li>
<li>4 things you can feel</li>
<li>3 things you can hear</li>
<li>2 things you can smell</li>
<li>1 thing you can taste</li>
<p>This calming technique can help you reduce anxiety and build emotional regulation skills.</p>
